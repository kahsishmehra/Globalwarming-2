    <h4>CLIMATE</h4>
    <p>The climate is defined as’ the general or average weather conditions of a certain region, including temperature, rainfall, and wind’. The earth’s climate is most affected by latitude, the tilt of the Earth's axis, the movements of the Earth's wind belts, and the difference in temperatures of land and sea, and topography. Human activity, especially relating to actions relating to the depletion of the ozone layer, is also an important factor.</p>
    <p>The climate system is a complex, interactive system consisting of the atmosphere, land surface, snow and ice, oceans and other bodies of water, and living things.</p>
    <h4>GREEN HOUSE EFFECT</h4>
    <p>Green House effect is the phenomenon whereby the earth's atmosphere traps solar radiation, and is mediated by the presence in the atmosphere of gases such as carbon dioxide, water vapor, and methane that allow incoming sunlight to pass through, but absorb vthe heat radiated back from the earth's surface.</p>
    <p>Thus the Green house gases (GHGs) provide a blanketing effect in the lower strata of the earth’s atmosphere, and this blanketing effect is being enhanced because of the human activities like burning of fossil fuels etc.</p>
    <h3>GLOBAL WARMING</h3>
    <p>‘Global warming is defined as an increase in the average temperature of the Earth's atmosphere, especially a sustained increase great enough to cause changes in the global climate’. </p>
    <p>The term global warming is synonymous with Enhanced green house effect, implying an increase in the amount of green house gases in the earth’s atmosphere, leading to entrapment of more and more solar radiations, and thus increasing the overall temperature of the earth.</p>
    <h4>EFFECT OF GLOBAL WARMING ON THE EARTH’S CLIMATE</h4>
    <p>Detailed researches of climatic events of the past 150 years have revealed that the temperatures have risen all over the globe, with the warming occurring in two phases. The first phase was from 1919 to 1940, with an average temperature gain of 0.35°C, and the second phase was from 1970 to the present, exhibiting temperature gains of 0.55°C. Records show that the past 25 years have been the warmest time of the past 5 centuries. The global warming has resulted in the warming of the oceans, rising of the sea levels, melting of glaciers, and diminished snow cover in the Northern  Hemisphere.</p>
    <h4>RECENT CLIMATIC DISASTERS IN INDIA</h4>
    <h2 align="center">FLOODS IN INDIA</h2>
    <p>India is the most flood distressed state in the world after Bangladesh, accounting for 1/ 5th of the global deaths every year with 30 million people displaced from their homes yearly. Approximately 40 million hectares of the land is vulnerable to floods, with 8 million hectares affected by it. Unprecedented floods take place every year at one place or the other, with the most vulnerable states of India being Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Assam, West Bengal, Gujarat, Orissa, Andhra Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Punjab and Jammu & Kashmir</p>
    <p>The climatic history of India is studded with a very large number of floods, which have wreaked havoc on the country’s economy. A chart showing the large number of floods in the Indian state with average financial, land and cattle loss is given below.</p>
    <h3>The top floods in India's History!</h3>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>FLOODS IN BIHAR</strong></li>
      <p>Bihar is an over populated state in Northern India, extremely prone to floods. The total area covered by the state of Bihar is 94,163 km2. Its average elevation above sea level is 173 feet.</p>
    <p>Bihar faces the predicament of floods almost every year, with the link between India and Nepal through the Koshi River being one of the main reasons for the flood in Bihar. Excessive rainfall due to the recent global warming in Nepal leads to an overloading of dams and leads to flash floods in the Bihar region. The Recent years in which human death due to flood is more than 100 are given in the figure below.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>a) 1987 Bihar Flood</strong></li>
    <p>The flood of 1987 in Bihar was so destructive that it left a total of 1400 people and more
    than 5000 animal dead. A total of 67,881+680.86 lac INR was the damage to the state;
    affecting more than 29 million people. After this flood, the River Koshi has been named
    as” Sorrow of Bihar” (Bihar ka shok).</p>
    <li><STRONG>b) 2008 Bihar floods</STRONG></li>
    <p>The 2008 Bihar floods are considered as one of the most disastrous floods in the state’s
    history. The flood affected more than 2 million people. The flooded and affected areas
    were Supaul, Araria, Madhepura, Saharsa, Champaran and Purnea.</p>
    </ul>
    <li><strong>OTHER MAJOR FLOODS IN INDIA</strong></li><br>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>2005: Maharashtra flood</strong></li>
      <p>In 2005, a major climatic catastrophe occurred in the state of Maharashtra in the form of
    massive floorings, leading to a death toll of 5000 people. The areas of Mumbai, Chiplun,
    Khed, Kalyan, Ratnagiri and Raigad were completely flooded, hence naming the date 26 July
    2005 as the BLACK DAY in the history of Mumbai. </p>
    <li><strong>2005: Gujarat Floods</strong></li>
    <p>the wave of floods in Maharashtra reached the state of Gujarat as well, accounting for one
    of the worst floods in the Indian History as it caused a financial loss of more than Rs.800
    million. This disaster took place in a row of days from 30th June to July 11, killing more
    than 123 people and a total of 250k people were evacuated. Infrastructure of the state also
    suffered badly as train services, Road Operations and communications were destroyed.</p>
    <li><strong>2007 South Asian Floods</strong></li>
    <p>In 2007, global warming finally triggered a flood formation that was so devastating, that it
    annihilated the entire South Asian region, destroying large zones in India, Pakistan, Nepal,
    Bhutan and Bangladesh. It’s most devastating effects were observed in South India, where
    it lasted for more than 15 days, killing more than 2000 people and affecting another 30
    million. It was termed by UNICEF to be the worst flooding of South India in living memory.</p>
